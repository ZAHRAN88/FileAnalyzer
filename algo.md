# File System Directory Tree Analyzer: Algorithms & Procedures

This document outlines the step-by-step procedures and algorithms implemented in the File System Analyzer application. It provides a detailed explanation of each core algorithm, from directory scanning to duplicate file detection.

## 1. Directory Scanning Algorithm

### Purpose
To recursively traverse the file system and build a hierarchical tree representation of directories and files.

### Algorithm Steps
1. Start with a root directory path provided by user
2. Create a tree node to represent the root directory
3. For each file in the directory:
   - Create a file node
   - Store file metadata (name, path, size, modification time)
   - Add to current directory's file collection
4. For each subdirectory in the directory:
   - Skip system and inaccessible directories
   - Recursively scan the subdirectory (return to step 2)
   - Add the returned directory node to parent's subdirectory collection
5. Return the complete directory tree structure

### Asynchronous Implementation
- The scanning process runs on a background thread
- Progress updates are reported back to the UI
- Error handling for access denied and other I/O exceptions

### Event Notifications
- DirectoryScanned: Fired when a directory is processed
- FileScanned: Fired when a file is discovered
- ScanProgressChanged: Provides progress updates during scanning

### Complexity Analysis
- Time Complexity: O(n) where n is the total number of files and directories
- Space Complexity: O(n) for storing the tree structure

## 2. Size Calculation Algorithm

### Purpose
To calculate size statistics for directories and identify the largest files.

### Directory Size Statistics Algorithm
1. Calculate total size of the root directory (including all subdirectories)
2. Create a size entry for the root directory (100% of total)
3. For each first-level subdirectory:
   - Calculate total size (including its subdirectories)
   - Calculate percentage of total size
   - Count total files (including in subdirectories)
   - Create size entry with name, path, size, percentage, and file count
4. Sort all entries by size (descending)
5. Return the sorted list of directory size entries

### Largest Files Algorithm
1. Recursively collect all files from the directory tree
2. Sort files by size in descending order
3. Return the top N files (where N is configurable)

### Helper Functions
- CalculateTotalSize: Recursively sums file sizes in a directory and all subdirectories
- GetAllFilesRecursive: Flattens the directory tree to get all files

### Complexity Analysis
- Time Complexity: 
  - Size calculation: O(n) where n is the total number of files
  - Finding largest files: O(n log n) due to sorting
- Space Complexity: O(n) to store information about all files and directories

## 3. File Hashing and Duplicate Detection Algorithm

### Purpose
To identify duplicate files within the directory structure using cryptographic hashing.

### Algorithm Steps

#### Hash Calculation
1. Open file stream for reading
2. Initialize MD5 or SHA-256 hash algorithm
3. Compute hash from file contents
4. Convert hash to hexadecimal string representation
5. Return the hash string

#### Duplicate Detection
1. Collect all files from the directory tree recursively
2. Group files by size (files with different sizes cannot be duplicates)
3. For each size group containing more than one file:
   - Calculate hash for each file
   - Store files in a dictionary, using hash as key
   - Mark files with the same hash as duplicates
4. Filter the dictionary to include only hashes with multiple files
5. Return the dictionary of duplicate file groups

### Optimization Techniques
1. Size-based Pre-filtering: Files of different sizes cannot be duplicates
2. Parallel Processing: Hash calculation is distributed across multiple threads
3. Cancelation Support: The operation can be canceled by the user

### Complexity Analysis
- Time Complexity: O(n × s) where n is the number of files and s is the average file size
- Space Complexity: O(n) for storing hash values and file metadata

## 4. File Search Algorithm

### Purpose
To find files matching specific criteria using wildcards and pattern matching.

### Algorithm Steps
1. Begin with the root directory node
2. For each file in the current directory:
   - Check if the file matches search criteria based on search type:
     * Name: Compare file name against pattern
     * Extension: Compare file extension against pattern
     * Size: Check if file size exceeds specified value
     * Path: Check if full path matches pattern
   - If match found, add to results list
3. For each subdirectory:
   - Recursively apply the search algorithm
   - Add matches to results list
4. Return complete list of matching files

### Wildcard Matching Algorithm
1. Convert wildcard pattern to regular expression pattern:
   - Escape special regex characters
   - Replace * with .* (any sequence of characters)
   - Replace ? with . (any single character)
2. Create regex with appropriate case sensitivity
3. Check if input matches the pattern
4. Return boolean result

### Complexity Analysis
- Time Complexity: O(n × m) where n is the number of files and m is the complexity of pattern matching
- Space Complexity: O(r) where r is the number of search results
